## Overview

I coded this solution for the Frontend Mentor Product preview card component challenge. Here, _I made the preview card with given color pallete using HTML5, CSS3 and concepts of Flexbox plus media query_. I tried to be exact to the design, so do check it out and feel free to leave any suggestion and improvements.

## My process

This was a little tough and challenging for me but I made it work using Flexbox as I wanted to learn its concept through this project. This is how I went for this:

- First, I made the basic structure and gave background color and color.
- Next, I made wrapper class to enclose my card and centered it using flex. I did the same inside the wrapper too. (You could do it with grid too) .
- Then, I applied the flexbox concept in the Product Details div too to properly align the sub-texts.
- In the end, it was trial and error to decide the font-size, margins, padding, line-spacing etc.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media Queries

### What I learned

I learned a lot lot through this project. I decided to learn **Flexbox** by implementing its concepts in this project and you can clearly see in the code that I have extensively used flexbox in this.
I also learned how **Media Queries** work by adding few modifications in the code for mobile view under it. But One thing I could have definitely improved upon would be **Mobile-First Approach** which I would try apply apply in some next project.
